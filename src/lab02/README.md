# Sorting 4 Integers in Ascending Order

## Objectives

The objective of this problem is to write a Python script that sorts four integers entered by the user in ascending order, using only if-statements.

## Requirements

- The script should prompt the user to enter four integers separated by a space.
- The script should use if-statements to compare the values of the four integers and swap them if necessary to sort them in ascending order.
- The sorted integers should be printed to the console, separated by a space.

## Example Usage

```
PS lab02> python .\main.py
1 6 2 4
1 2 4 6

PS lab02> python .\main.py
5 7 2 4
2 4 5 7

PS lab02> python .\main.py
-1 -2 -5 -3
-5 -3 -2 -1
```
