# Find The Middle Value

## Objectives

The objective of the script is to take in five integer values from the user and then find the middle value along with its position in the list.

## Requirements

- The script takes five unique integer values as input from the user, separated by spaces.
- The script compares the input values to each other to find the middle value and its position in the list.
- The script prints the middle value along with its position in the list.
- The script assumes that the user will input five unique integer values separated by spaces.
- The script is only allowed to use if-statements to solve this problem. Other control structures such as loops or functions are not allowed.

## Example Usage

```
PS lab03> python .\main.py
1 5 2 3 4
3 3

PS lab03> python .\main.py
