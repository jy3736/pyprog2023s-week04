## Python programming assignment submission instructions

- To ensure a fair evaluation, please do not modify any files or directories outside the `"src"` directory. All of your code should be placed inside the `"src"` directory.
- For the most part, you'll just need to write your code in the "main.py" file located under each "lab" or "hw" directory. Unless you're certain of what you're doing, please avoid modifying any other files in these directories.
- To submit your assignment, please use the `"submit"` command. You can execute this command by typing `"submit"` in your terminal. 
- Please note that you can only submit your assignment up to `5 times`, so make sure to test your code thoroughly before submitting.
- If you're having trouble executing the `"submit"` command, try changing its mode by typing `"chmod +x submit"` in your terminal, and then try again.

### Good luck with your programming assignment!
